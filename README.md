# Infra

üåßÔ∏è Automated infrastructure and demo provisioning

## Development

Infra (the server) and infractl (the cli) are written in Go, and use gRPC for client-server communication.

### Regenerate Go bindings from protos

To regenerate the Go proto bindings, run:

`make proto-generated-srcs`

### Building the server and cli

To compile a server and client binary, run:

`make server cli-local`

### Building or pushing images

GitHub Actions will build and push the infra-server image based on `make tag` of
the most recent commit. Or you can build and push locally if you have the
correct tooling installed with:

`make image` or `make push`
