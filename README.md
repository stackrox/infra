# Infra

üåßÔ∏è Automated infrastructure and demo provisioning

## Development

Infra (the server) and infractl (the cli) are written in Go, and use gRPC for
client-server communication. The UI uses a React/Typescript/Yarn toolchain (see
(ui/README.md)[ui/README.md]).

While a development workflow can be achieved using a locally installed
toolchain, it is also possible to rely on CI. CI will lint, build and push the
infra server. And then deploy it to a development cluster created using the
production infra deployment. A
(comment)[https://github.com/stackrox/infra/pull/711#issuecomment-1270457578]
will appear on PRs with more detail. 

### Regenerate Go bindings from protos

To regenerate the Go proto bindings, run:

`make proto-generated-srcs`

### Building the server and cli

To compile a server and client binary, run:

`make server cli-local`

### Building or pushing images

GitHub Actions will build and push the infra-server image based on `make tag` of
the most recent commit. Or you can build and push locally if you have the
correct tooling installed with:

`make image push`
